## Problem Statement

Madhav E-commerce generates a significant amount of sales data. Without an effective way to visualize and analyze this data, it's difficult to:

*   Gain a holistic view of sales performance across different dimensions (e.g., region, product category, customer).
*   Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in sales data.
*   Make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies and improve business outcomes.
*   Quickly identify top-performing and underperforming areas of the business.

This dashboard aims to address these challenges by providing an interactive and insightful overview of Madhav E-commerce's sales data.

## Data Sources

(This section requires information about the actual data sources used. Assuming a common scenario:)

*   **Sales Database:** Likely a relational database (e.g., MySQL) containing transactional data (orders, products, customers, etc.).
*   **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System:** Potentially containing additional customer data.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

*   **Handling Missing Values:** Addressing missing data in fields like customer addresses or product descriptions.
*   **Data Type Conversion:** Ensuring correct data types for calculations and visualizations (e.g., converting date strings to date objects).
*   **Data Transformation:** Calculating new metrics like Average Order Value (AOV) or profit margins.

## Dashboard Development

The dashboard was developed using Power BI. The development process involved:

1.  **Data Connection:** Connecting Power BI to the data source(s).
2.  **Data Modeling:** Creating relationships between tables to enable data analysis across different dimensions.
3.  **Visualization Creation:** Designing charts, graphs, and other visual elements to represent the data effectively.
4.  **Interactive Elements:** Implementing filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities for user interaction.

## Key Metrics and Visualizations

Here's a breakdown of the key metrics and visualizations in the dashboard:

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

    *   **Sum of Amount (Total Sales):** 438K (Overall sales revenue)
